## Introduction

This template repository provides a pre-configured Terramate project to get started with **Terramate** and **Terraform** on **AWS**
using best practices. It also comes with pre-configured GitOps workflows that run natively in GitHub Actions so that you
can automate your Terraform in Pull Requests without requiring any additional tooling or infrastructure using the
Terramate orchestration and change detection.

### Features

- **GitOps for Terraform with GitHub Actions**: Pre-configured GitHub Action GitOps workflows using merge-and-apply strategy.
- **Recommended Project Structure**: Best practice project structure to get up and running in no time.
- **Change Preview in Pull Requests**: Preview and approval of plans in Pull Requests to review and approve changes before deploying.
- **DRY Terraform Stacks**: Generate Terraform provider and backend configuration in stacks.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Allows GitHub Actions workflows to access AWS resources without storing long-lived GitHub secrets.
- **Terraform S3 Remote State Backend**: Terraform Remote State Storage and State Locking with AWS S3 and DynamoDB.
- **Terramate Cloud Integration**: Pushes data to Terramate Cloud for observability, asset management, drift management, and Slack notifications.

## How do you use this repository?

### 1: Create a new repository from this template

Click the *Use this template* button to create your own repository in a GitHub
account or organization you manage, and let's get started.

### 2: Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites set up by running the commands below:

1. Install asdf: Follow the [official guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

2. Install required `asdf` plugins for Terramate and Terraform:
  
    ```bash
    asdf plugin add terramate && \
    asdf plugin add terraform && \
    asdf plugin add pre-commit && \
    asdf install
     ```

3. *(Optional)* If you need to create a Terraform State Bucket and Workload Identity Provider, you need to configure your AWS
credentials using one of the supported [authentication mechanisms](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration).
(We recommend you use [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) for secure authentication.)

3. *(Optional)* Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks

We recommend installing the pre-commit hooks in this repository to enable a seamless development flow. The hooks guarantee
that your Terramate and Terraform code is always up-to-date and well-formatted when committing changes to the repository.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### Configure Terraform State Bucket and Workload Identity Provider

This repository comes with a pre-configured Terraform S3 State Bucket, DynamoDB Lock Table and Workload Identity Provider to enable keyless authentication from GitHub Actions to AWS.

#### Update Terramate Configurations

- Navigate to the `config.tm.hcl` file in your project's root directory.
- Replace the default Terraform State Bucket name with a name of your choice.
```bash
globals "terraform" "backend" {
  bucket = "any-name-you-want"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

- Update the GitHub repository name for the workload identity provider with your repository (`<githubuserororganization/repository-name>`).
```bash
globals "aws" "oidc" {
  github_repositories = [
    "your-github-username-or-organization/repository-name",
  ]
}
```

#### Generate Terraform Files from Terramate Configurations

Generate Terraform files using Terramate:
```bash
terramate generate
```
The `terramate generate` command generates files/code in stacks and helps to keep your stacks [DRY](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/code-generation/#introduction). In the `_bootstrap/terraform-state-bucket` directory, the `config.tm.hcl` file includes a `generate_hcl` block which specifies the HCL code that will be generated by the generate command.
Because we run the command without specifying the [context](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/code-generation/#generation-context), the default `stack` context is used and generates code relative to the stack where the config file is defined(`terraform-state-bucket` stack in this case). The generated code can be located in the `_main.tf` file within the same directory.

####  Provision Infrastructure on AWS

To deploy the generated resources to AWS, use the following commands:

```bash
terramate run -C _bootstrap terraform init
terramate run -C _bootstrap terraform apply
```

#### Migrate State to S3 Bucket

Now that we have the Terraform State Bucket deployed, we want to move the state of the newly deployed bucket and workload
identity provider into the bucket.

1. Remove `tags = ["no-backend"]` from `stack.tm.hcl` files of the `_bootstrap/oidc-aws-github` and
`/bootstrap/terraform-state-bucket` directories.

2. Generate Terraform configuration files:
```bash
terramate generate
```
This will create a `_backend.tf` file in both stack directories.

3. Initialize Terraform for state migration:
```bash
terramate run -C _bootstrap terraform init
```
This command will move the state of deployed stacks to the S3 bucket.

### Create Terramate Cloud Account
